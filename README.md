# US-homelessness-R-project
This was my first attempt at a more challenging R project - I worked on it during the Spring of 2021. My goal was to see how homelessness in the U.S. might change with other economic factors.
In this project, I synthesized 15 years' worth of state-level economic and homelessness data from multiple sources into one dataset. I then analyzed this data with R and created statistical models that used the economic data to predict how homelessness would change in response.
